        <h1>Welcome to Moop UK! Currently in the making.</h1>
        <h2>Beep boop lettuce!</h2>
		<p>This is a work in progress, but hopes to be up and running as soon as possible. Thank you for your 
		patience!</p>
		<p>
		Hello! Most of the time I'm known online as 'Kouda_Ha' (he/they) and I made this site to start my passion project of 
		an open-source, indie dev company/community. I think it'd be cool to have a free and open games 
		development and gaming community that showcases people's work and gives them some exposure. 
		<br>
		As getting into the games industry is difficult to do, I wanted to make something that would be fun, 
		helpful, and it also means that I can still make games whiles I'm also looking for work.
		<br>
		As someone with health issues, from the LGBTQIA+ community, and as someone who grew up in a working class background where 
		education wasn't seen as important, I want to make something accessible, promoting free education, 
		and something that encourages everyone to be their best and true self, and somewhere you don't have to be scared 
		of trying something new.
		<br>
		This is where Moop UK comes in, thought of in 2022, and made after handing in my final piece of coursework in May 2023, 
		Moop UK will start on it's journey to be an all inclusive, friendly and welcoming game environment.
		</p>
		<h3>Moop possibilities:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Game Jams</li>
          <li>Live-streaming games/demos from indie devs</li>

          <li>Open-source and volunteering</li>
