        <h3>Moop News</h3>
        <h4>Moop Update Moop X PEN</h4>
        <h5>January 2026</h5>
        <p>Moop is teaming up with PEN (Paper Empathy Network) to make a diverse community of people both 
		in games (and open-source), and people that like physical hobbies and crafts. 
		<br> 
		To make it easier on both Moop and PEN, they're revamping themselves.
		<br>
		Moop is going to run Game Jams in 2026, with the limitation "Open-source only" for submissions.
		<br>
		There will be fun themes for each Game Jam, and possibly a Discord for (both) Moop X PEN, where communities can mingle together.
		<br>
		To make it easier on the social media manager, the socials for both will be shared/merged together.
		<br>Thank you for your support thus far and we hope you like this new collaboration in 2026.
		  </p>

	<h1> Welcome to Moop, a passion project based in the UK. If you have any questions, please contact Moop on any of our social media found to the side in 'Useful Links'.</h1>
	<h2> This is a skeleton website, apologies for how terrible it looks. It'll just have a short paragraph on what Moop is, and links to the Game Jams that Moop will host in 2026.</h2>
	<h3> Moop wishes to make and spread awareness of open source games that use solely free open source technology for all of their 
		games development.<br>
		We have decided to host Game Jams on <a href="https://itch.io">Itch.io</a> with the limitation that submissions must use only 
		open source technology for the entire game process, and Generative AI is not allowed under any circumstance (not even if it's open source lol).
		<br>
		We're merging with PEN (Paper Empathy Network), a Penpal company who are setting up a more physical and in-person community to help with things like isolation, 
		as well as encouraging us to take a step back from our phones/screens to live in reality and do things like physically writing letters and stories instead of 
		using a keyboard and read physical books, and so on.
		<br>
		Please look forward to what is to come! And thank you for your support thus far.
