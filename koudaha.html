		<h3>COVER LETTER</h3>
		<p>During the past couple of years, I’ve been concentrating on my studies whiles dabbling in some game jams 
		and open-source volunteer work. I would ultimately like to work for a games company, but in general I am looking 
		for game development/design/testing or project management, via internships and/or work positions for when I 
		graduate in June 2023.
		<br>My dissertation project was an educational game, a silly horror game for one of the ‘Mathematics’ modules 
		taught at my university. The dissertation report was titled ‘Converting of a University Teaching Unit into a 
		Computer Games (Gamification)’. The full design and concept of the game is my own work, and it was designed 
		around a real-world experience I had in the math module, where students would ask why we’re learning math when 
		we’re programmers. In the game, a ghost who loves math hears this and teleports the students to a horror version 
		of the university, forcing them to complete math to leave, the final “boss” being your end of year exam.
		<br>For group work, at the end of my third year I pitched a videogame and won one of the project places in 
		‘Advanced Computer Games Design’, making me the project manager. I am now very confident in Jira due to this 
		and find it fun to use. I’m also rather confident with GitHub usage, as I was the main person to check the 
		branches and solve merge conflicts in pull requests to be merged into main. The videogame I pitched was an 
		‘Animal Care Simulator’ and it is supposed to teach animal care and be realistic. I designed the game from 
		scratch, and even made a rapid prototype of the game world for the game pitch (rapid prototype found here: 
		https://kouda-ha.itch.io/zoo-sim) and for a build of the finished vertical slice (found here: https://kouda-ha.itch.io/pets).
		<br>I also have quite a lot of experience in rapid prototyping due to a module entitled ‘Game A Week’ during 
		my second year of university. Where we were given a theme each Monday and expected to deliver a finished game 
		by the following Sunday.
		<br>
		There’s also the hobby of attempting to speed run games, meaning I am perfectly happy to be playing the same 
		scenes repeatedly. Another thing speed running teaches people is to find bugs in already released games to 
		exploit that for faster completion times or PBs (personal bests), so QA testing is another job role I’d be interested in. 
		<br>I am very willing to learn new tools and techniques as literally any experience in anything computing and 
		game related is positive and beneficial. Any books or training you’d suggest I investigate prior to starting 
		is also very welcome as I like to be overly prepared. I want to be involved in games as a future job role mainly 
		because I like seeing games take shape and evolve over the process from design to implementation, it is very 
		enjoyable to me.
		<br>
		I understand as a soon-to-be fresh graduate, even if I have experience with designing and making games, 
		using a variety of game engines, and so on, I won’t have industry experience, but if you feel like I would be a good fit for a 
		job role, I would love to hear from you. I can start immediately.
		<br>
		Contacting me on LinkedIn, Twitter dm, Instagram dm, my job email, literally any method you prefer is great and I look 
		forward to hearing from you.
